/**
 * @mainpage
 *
 * RELIC is a modern cryptographic meta-toolkit with emphasis on efficiency and
 * flexibility. RELIC can be used to build efficient and usable cryptographic
 * toolkits tailored for specific security levels and algorithmic choices.
 *
 * @section goals_sec Goals
 *
 * RELIC is an ongoing project and features will be added on demand.
 * The focus is to provide:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> Ease of portability and inclusion of architecture-dependent code
 * <li> Simple experimentation with alternative implementations
 * <li> Tests and benchmarks for every implemented function
 * <li> Flexible configuration
 * <li> Maximum efficiency
 * </ul>
 *
 * @section algo_sec Algorithms
 *
 * RELIC implements to date:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> Multiple-precision integer arithmetic
 * <li> Prime and Binary field arithmetic
 * <li> Elliptic curves over prime and binary fields (NIST curves and
 * pairing-friendly curves)
 * <li> Bilinear maps and related extension fields
 * <li> Cryptographic protocols
 * </ul>
 *
 * @section lic_sec Licensing
 *
 * RELIC is released under an LGPL version 2.1-or-above license to encourage
 * collaboration with other research groups and contributions from the industry.
 *
 * @section disc_sec Disclaimer
 *
 * RELIC is alpha-quality software. Implementations may not be correct or secure
 * and may include patented algorithms. Backward API compatibility with early
 * versions may not necessarily be maintained. Use at your own risk.
