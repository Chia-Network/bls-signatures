=====

RELIC is a modern cryptographic meta-toolkit with emphasis on efficiency and flexibility. RELIC can be used to build efficient and usable cryptographic toolkits tailored for specific security levels and algorithmic choices.

### Goals

RELIC is an ongoing project and features will be added on demand. The focus is to provide:

 * Ease of portability and inclusion of architecture-dependent code
 * Simple experimentation with alternative implementations
 * Tests and benchmarks for every implemented function
 * Flexible configuration
 * Maximum efficiency

### Algorithms

RELIC implements to date:

 * Multiple-precision integer arithmetic
 * Prime and Binary field arithmetic
 * Elliptic curves over prime and binary fields (NIST curves and pairing-friendly curves)
 * Bilinear maps and related extension fields
 * Cryptographic protocols (RSA, Rabin, ECDSA, ECMQV, ECSS (Schnorr), ECIES, Sakai-Ohgishi-Kasahara ID-based authenticated key agreement, Boneh-Lynn-Schacham and Boneh-Boyen short signatures, Paillier and Benaloh homomorphic encryption systems)
d
RELIC is being used as the main cryptography implementation of the [TinyPBC](http://sites.google.com/site/tinypbc/) project. Support was included in version 0.1.1. Build instructions for MICAz motes suitable for TinyPBC deployments can be found in the Wiki.

### Citing

If you use RELIC, please cite using the template below:

    @misc{relic-toolkit,
        author = {D. F. Aranha and C. P. L. Gouv\^{e}a},
        title = {{RELIC is an Efficient LIbrary for Cryptography}},
        howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic}},
    }`

### Licensing

RELIC is released under an LGPL version 2.1-or-above license to encourage collaboration with other research groups and contributions from the industry.

Starting from version 0.3.3, static linking and changes in the configuration or build system are explicitly exempted from representing derived works. Please refer to files COPYING and COPYING.LESSER for additional details.

### Build instructions

Instructions for building the library can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/relic-toolkit/relic/wiki/Building).

### Donations

If you like RELIC, please consider supporting development through [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=R7D6ZE3BLMTF2&lc=BR&item_name=RELIC%20Development&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted).

### Disclaimer

RELIC is at most alpha-quality software. Implementations may not be correct or secure and may include patented algorithms. There are *many* configuration options which make the library horribly insecure. Backward API compatibility with early versions may not necessarily be maintained. Use at your own risk.
