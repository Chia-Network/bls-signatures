# BLS12-381 and Signatures in python

Implements the BLS12 curve and optimal ate pairing, as well
as BLS signatures and aggregation. Use for reference / educational purposes only.

For an optimized implementation, use the [Python bindings](https://github.com/Chia-Network/bls-signatures/tree/main/python-bindings).

For a good introduction to pairings, read [Pairings for Beginners](http://www.craigcostello.com.au/pairings/PairingsForBeginners.pdf) by Craig Costello.

Map to curve implementation from [Algorand](https://github.com/algorand/bls_sigs_ref/).

Run the tests with `python impl-test.py`.
